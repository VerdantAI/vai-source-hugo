Most of my friends already know that I'm obsessed with building replicants. In fact
the name of my (admittedly terrible) beer-league ice hockey team is "The Blade Runners". Kudos
to John Thantranon for the name.

A few days ago I decided to build automated Mullas, one that quotes from the Quran
and the other that quotes from the King James Bible.  I figured if I could get those
two talking, I would have solved a pretty important issue.

Well, I couldn't.  I have a system that allows multiple autonomous agents to communicate
via natural language. It's pretty simple, but incredibly fun to watch.  The first thing
I did was to get the Muppets chatting with each other, and that worked great.  My wife
was a little taken aback by having Kermit swear at Miss Piggy (so the repo is not public...)

The Mullas, on the other hand, could not create any volleys. That is, responding to
the other speakers prompts.  I think the reason is the language comprehension is looking
for unusual factors rather than the mundane use of words.  For instance, in a primitive
example, "lamb" often translates to "land". I need to fix my spell checker!

I'll go back to "Country Bear Jamboree" for a bit, as solving World Peace is going to
take more than a few lines of Python.
