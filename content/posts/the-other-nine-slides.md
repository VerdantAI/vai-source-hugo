Being the technical Co-Founder brings it's own set of challenges.  I rather hate it,
but I know that when I am left to my own devices I start building things, not
spreadsheets.  For decades, I've been the guy touching bare wires
in the garage.

This makes me and (and presumably you) the IP guy. Our company can solve this problem
"faster", "smarter" or just plain "better" because of the work you and I do.  In tech
companies, it's no understatement to say the company cannot exist without us. There
would be no IP, no solution, and no investment capital.  A common pattern is for us
to have some crazy idea, then go looking for a co-founder to turn it into a business.
I've done that multiple times.  "Hey, here is my crazy prototype, can you help me sell
it to someone?"

So you've spent a year in the back office, making sure your creature can
duke it out with all the other creatures.  You met a guy who says he can sell it for
a billion dollars, and you're ready to raise money.  Then the crappy part happens:
The other nine slides.

Probably the most fashionable template is the [Guy Kawasaki Deck](https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/). It calls for
the following slides.

1. Title: Duh, title.
1. Problem / Opportunity: What are you solving?
1. Value Proposition: How you address the above.
1. Underlying Magic: What you and I have been doing in the garage for a year.
1. Business Model: Guy in suit stuff
1. Go-To-Market Plan: More guy in suit stuff
1. Competitive Analysis: Yet more guy in suit stuff.
1. Management Team: Braggin'
1. Financial Projections: Lies the guy in the suit will tell and no one will believe.
1. Status and Use of Funds: Can we be done with the guy in suit stuff?

That's right, we get ONE SLIDE. Everyone will give you lip service about how important
that ONE SLIDE actually is, but they won't spend any time on it.  They'll just assume
you're telling the truth and you can do that magical thing you claim you can do.

This is right, and this is natural. But it really sucks.  Let me give you an analogy: Cars.
Anyone who knows me knows I hate cars.  I'm a cyclist and a fan of the metro and
I enjoy a good three hour walk several times a week.  Cars don't play into any of
that.  Oh, I have a car, to be sure--I have kids to get to school through the heady
tidewaters of Los Angeles--but I don't like it.

I wasn't there, but when the car was invented, I bet a lot of mechanical guys had
complete conniption fits.  I have a good mechanic friend (who lives a walkable distance) that
can't stop telling me about something the Mazda that makes it
accelerate differently than the other cars.  I think it's Mazda.  It's not Toyota...
